-0-the_sky_is_the_limit_not.pp: Puppet manifest that increases the amount of traffic an Apache web server can effectively handle.
##1. User limit

-1-user_limit.pp: Puppet manifest that changes the operating system configuration so that it is possible to login with the user holberton and open a file without error.
